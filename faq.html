                <h3>“Is fruit bad for me because it contains sugar?”</h3><br/>
                Sugar gets such a bad rap in the popular press that some people hesitate to eat foods that contain natural sugars, 
                especially fruit. There’s plenty of research exposing the detrimental health effects of eating too much added sugar, 
                but less so with natural sugars. Overall, fruit intake is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, 
                high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes.

                <h3>“Are canned and frozen fruits and vegetables lower in nutrients?”</h3><br/>
                Frozen green beansThe answer is, 
                it all depends—on the type of produce, 
                the type of processing, and which nutrients. 
                In general, fresh produce picked at peak maturity offers the highest 
                amount of vitamins and minerals and tastes the best, but soon after harvest 
                these nutrients degrade. It can take 1-2 weeks for produce to be transported 
                from farms to supermarkets and then purchased by the consumer. 
                Several more days may pass before you actually eat it. Part of the nutrient 
                losses occur with moisture loss if water-rich produce sits at room temperature. 
                Estimates show that at room temperature, fresh peas lose about 50% of vitamin C in one week, 
                and fresh spinach can lose 100% of the vitamin in less than 4 days. (1)
